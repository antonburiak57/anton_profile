                    <p>In back-end development, my current stack involves Elixir & Phoenix, NodeJS and nest.js, and Ruby on Rails. Nearly every app I have launched in the past had the back-end done also by me. In order to improve the development speed, performance and reliability, I have changed languages and frameworks already multiple times, from PHP, Ruby.</p>
                    <p>The lessons I learned while doing all these apps will be useful for me forever, no matter what framework I will use in the next project.</p>
                    <p>What I can do for you at that side is:</p>

                    <li>Refactoring existing applications, by improving code readibility, separating concerns into separate functions/classes/modules, taking the business logic out from your request/response layer into separate modules (DDD), and moving the app architecture into an event-based one</li>
                    <li>Writing unit and E2E tests</li>
